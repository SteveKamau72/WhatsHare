WhatsHare
=========

Share links and text between Android devices or between your desktop Chrome browser and your Android device!

Install the app on both your Android devices, pair them, and start sharing!

You can share with any app (including SMS messaging, BlueTooth, Copy to clipboard, ...), and you can choose the WhatsApp shortcut to quickly share with it.

This app is not affiliated in any way with WhatsApp Inc., quick links to WhatsApp are there just because that's what I wrote this app for: to share stuff from my PC/tablet with friends on WhatsApp.

Download the companion Chrome Extension to enable sharing between your desktop/notebook and your Android devices: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mghncekchoedpbbpidmeohijjgjlpgib

GitHub project for the browser extension can be found at https://github.com/micheleb/WhatsHare-Chrome
