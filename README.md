WhatsHare
=========

Share links and text between Android devices or between your desktop Chrome browser and your Android device!

Install the app on both your Android devices, pair them, and start sharing!

You can share with any app (including SMS messaging, BlueTooth, Copy to clipboard, ...), and you can choose the WhatsApp shortcut to quickly share with it.

This app is not affiliated in any way with WhatsApp Inc., quick links to WhatsApp are there just because that's what I wrote this app for: to share stuff from my PC/tablet with friends on WhatsApp.

Installing
----------

Download the companion Chrome Extension [from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatshare/mghncekchoedpbbpidmeohijjgjlpgib "WhatsHare on the Chrome Web Store") (the Chrome extension is also [on GitHub](https://github.com/WhatsHare/WhatsHare-Chrome "The Chrome extension's GitHub project")), install the Android app [from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.mb.whatshare "WhatsHare on the Play Store") and pair your devices following the in-app instructions to enable sharing between your desktop/notebook and your Android devices.



Sharing
-------

To share a link, right-click on it, select "WhatsHare" from the context menu, and then "Share link" or "Share link on Whatsapp". You will receive a notification on your Android device. If you choose the Whatsapp entry, you're greeted with Whatsapp's Chats page; otherwise, you will need to choose the app that should manage the incoming link/text from a dialog (if it's a link, you will get a list of browsers, if it's text, you will get all your social apps like Facebook, Gmail, Evernote, Hangouts, etc.).

To share text, select it and right click on it.

To share a link to the page that you're currently viewing, right-click anywhere on the page (but not on a link or image).
